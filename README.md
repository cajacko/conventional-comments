A Google Chrome extension for encouraging you to write [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) in Pull Requests.

## Roadmap

- ~~v1 - GitHub only, just shows a reminder above the comment input~~ (done)
- v2 - Show templates of the format
- v3 - Helper form that injects the formatted text to the first line of the comment
